text zero-shot learning is quite simple in it's nature especially with pretrained models. Models already know sentiment from the training they've been through, so its relatively easy to ask them weather a movie review is "Positive" or "Negative" just by asking.

Besides that with zero-shot text classification you can also seperate between subject [sport, technology, health] etc. instead of sentiment.
